<h2>1. Do longer or shorter length albums tend to generate more revenue?</h2>

<h2>1. How much revenue is generated each year, and what is its percent change 4 from the previous year?</h2>
<pre><code>    Hint: The InvoiceDate field is formatted as ‘yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss’. Try taking a look at using the strftime() function to help extract just the year. Then, we can use a subquery in the SELECT statement to query the total revenue from the previous year. Remember that strftime() returns the date as a string, so we would need to CAST it to an integer type for this part. Finally, since we cannot refer to a column alias in the SELECT statement, it may be useful to use the WITH clause to query the previous year total in a temporary table, and then calculate the percent change in the final SELECT statement.</code></pre>
