Hi. Here's some things I've been doing and stuff that's been on my mind:

---

## :hammer: Woodworking

I spent the near entirety of November at my mom's home, helping her recover after a surgery. I decided that a good, supplementary, and stress relieving use of that timme would be to woodwork. This was correct. I'm working on producing a bunch of the same thing. (Perhaps I'll send a picture of the best looking one of the completed ones) as well as a new desk for myself for my mom's home, a Christmas gift for her, and a drawer for one of my woodshop cabinets.

I successfully completed the drawer... except because it was my first time building a drawer from scratch, I built it where the bottom was too large so the sides didn't completely meet and I only realized this once I had begun applying glue.

**Lesson learned**: Don't rush.

I'll get to finishing the other projects over the next month or so. Perhaps I'll send Christmas Gifts out on time this year. Perhaps I won't. :shrug:

## :computer: Working

In case you haven't talked to me in a long time or need it written down somewhere, I'm a data analyst at a research hospital. My [team](https://d3b.center/) is trying to make genomic data easier to access for less money. The goal is to empower scientists and doctors to find better treatments - and perhaps cures - for pediatric cancers more quickly than ever before.

I've been writing a lot of code, talking to a lot of people, and looking at a lot of data. It's a lot of fun and obviously, it consumes a lot of my days. This work makes me very happy, is empowering, and I work on an amazing team.

## :beer: Brewing Beer

Like I said above, I was away last month so I haven't gotten to brew much beer.

That said, in 2021, I became a certified beer judge. That means i get to go to beer competitions and taste things and write down my thoughts on the things I taste. Judging beer is more challenging than I ever thought it would be. It's also a ton of fun.

## :dog2: Walking my dog

I have a dog. She's a pitbull mix.

It's a **_PITTIE_** I didn't get a dog before.

She's great. She's a brat. She's spoiled rotten. I love her to bits. Ask me for a picture of her and I'll send you one.

_Let me know if I should get stickers of her made_. If enough people say I should, I may send you one.

## :notes: Live music

This past week I saw **live music** for the first time since before the pandemic. It was glorious. If you know me even slightly it should come as no surprise that I went to ska/punk shows.

### Jeff Rosenstock

[Jeff Rosenstock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Rosenstock) is a solo punk musician who plays with a touring band because punk music played by one person would be .... actually it would be fun but I also totally get how one would want to have complete creative control over their thing.

The show was my first since the pandemic started. It was a bunch of fun to see other humans that look like they go to shows - think denim jackets with patches and skinny jeans and did you know people still wear beanies that don't cover their entire head but only like - the back third of their head? I love people at shows.

### Streetlight Manifesto (and Catbite)

This was my upteenth time seeing [Streetlight Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_Manifesto). They're a folk-ska-punk band that's been around since before I cared much about music or much of anything. They always put on a great show. Lots of dancing and flailing and moshing was had. I told my friend that I would never forget that show. I think that may end up being one of the best shows of my life.

The show was opened by the ska/ rock-&-roll band, [Catbite](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5ZymRXV10TmuDovZVrx2RP?si=DTtd_6ThQeKVcZT71piK-Q). They may be my favorite band. They are a ton of fun to listen and shake your booty to. Their style caters to basically everyone. [^catbite]

## :tangerine: What's the difference between clementines and mandarin oranges? [^capitalization]

I think about this every time I go to the store. I love tiny, orange citrus fruit that isn't too _anything_. Tiny oranges are my favorite snack. When I go to the store, I always gravitate towards the tiny oranges. But I've been thinking about how some stores have clemintines and some stores have mandarin oranges.

I've got many questions:

1. What's the difference between clementines and mandarin oranges?
2. Why don't stores ever have both? [^shopping]
3. what would I choose if I _actually_ had an option

After an investigation that lasted many, many seconds and a search that encompassed nearly the entire [page on the difference between clemntines and mandarin oranges](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-clementine-and-vs-mandarin/), I can tell you that I now know my preference is for clementines because they are supposed to be sweeter and because they are seedless.

I now also know that clementines are a hybrid, created by a French Missionary in Algeria. I don't know how to feel about that, but I can say that it's my preference. I know that because the tiny oranges I currently have in my fridge are Mandarin oranges.

_And I don't like it_.

I picked up this bag of Mandarin oranges at Trader Joes because I wanted a tart, sweet, citrussy snack. Instead I got a fruit that was hard to peel, and even worse: THESE MANDARIN ORANGES HAVE SEEDS AND I CAN'T STAND IT.

### I don't like seeds in my oranges

Seriously. This sucks. I have one of these half opened on my desk and I'm dreading finishing it because I know i'll have to deal with the big seeds in this tiny fruit.

All of this makes me wonder:

### Why do we have seedless oranges, watermelons, and grapes, but no seedless apples?

I almost always love the webiste/ podcast/ media juggernaught, _How Stuff Works_ but thery're wrong when they [glorify seeded watermelons](https://recipes.howstuffworks.com/calling-watermelon-seedless-false-advertising.htm):

> So, those unsatisfying white seeds just hang out in the watermelon's pink flesh, with no use except to remind you that you could be spitting shiny onyx projectiles at your brother â€” if only you had gotten the right kind of watermelon.

I never enjoyed having to deal with black watermelon seeds and I never will.

Because of my question, I did learn that [**seedless grapes do have a seed, it just lacks the hard coating that makes it seed-like**](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/botany/question349.htm)

Turns out, a woman in Huntington Park, CA had a tree that made seedless Apples in... [1940](http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,849570,00.html). But what about today?

I have no clue. Please tell me if you know of any seedless apples.

If you made it this far, congratulations. Let me know if i should write more about things i think about and do - or if I should stop. I don't want to share things over social media because social media generally makes me unhappy. So I figured sharing my thoughts in a newsletter would do well. At least there's no ads from me :shrug:

[^shopping]: I say it like I know this to be true, but It's very possible that I've been in one or many stores with an option for clementines or mandarin oranges.
[^capitalization]: Should i capitalize clementine? Mandarin oranges? Do I just call them mandarins? or do I clarify they're mandarin oranges? If I specify that the mandarins in question are oranges, do I capitalize the `m` in mandarin and the `o` in oranges or just the `m`?
[^catbite]: You can't see me, but I promise i'm in [this crowd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEPNrpI8HZc). Just a warning, there's swearing in this video.
