I'm Chris Friedman.

By day, you can find me working on projects at a major academic hospital.

By night and on the weekends, you can find my futzing with my home network, brewing beer, gardening, woodworking, or hiking with my dog.

I like to analyze and think about data.

I also _really like_ the Simpsons.
